# Manufacturing SQL
This code base contains the structure for a simulated manufacturing database.
This database is a great tool for learning SQL with manufacturing system specific context.
This database could also be used for SQL Interviews. There are hundreds of potential queries which could be built off of this data set, and the hope is that the data structures offer a lite representation of a real world manufacturing business.

To understand the tables, check out `mes_tables.py` and `erp_tables.py` which contain the column structures.

Data has been generated using custom scripts to provide the db with some fake data about an imaginary candy factory.
